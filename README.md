# Database Systems Lab

**Semester 2 (2025-26)**
**Language: SQL**

This repository contains SQL queries and solutions for weekly lab exercises in the Database Systems (DBMS) course. Each folder corresponds to one week of lab work and includes well-documented SQL queries and explanations.

---

## Folder-wise Breakdown

### **WEEK1 — Basic SQL Queries**

* Writing simple SQL queries to select, insert, update, and delete records.
* Use of `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` statements to manage student and sales records.
* Applying basic conditions using `WHERE`, `AND`, and `OR`.

### **WEEK2 — Joins and Subqueries**

* Writing SQL queries involving `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, and `FULL OUTER JOIN`.
* Using subqueries for filtering and sorting data.
* Understanding and applying relationships between multiple tables.

### **WEEK3 — SQL Aggregation Functions**

* Using aggregation functions like `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MAX()`, and `MIN()`.
* Grouping results with the `GROUP BY` clause and filtering with `HAVING`.
* Writing queries to calculate total sales, average purchases, and number of customers.

### **WEEK4 — Database Design and Normalization**

* Designing tables and relationships using Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD).
* Applying normalization techniques to eliminate redundancy and improve data integrity.
* Converting ERD to relational schema.

### **WEEK5 — SQL Queries for Complex Operations**

* Writing SQL queries for data manipulation involving JOINs, GROUP BY, and aggregate functions.
* Querying for highest sales, most frequent customers, and more.
* Working with multiple tables to retrieve meaningful insights.

### **WEEK6 — SQL Queries with Aggregate Functions**

* Demonstrating the use of SQL aggregate functions like `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MAX()`, and `MIN()`.
* Creating SQL queries to calculate total sales, average purchase amount, and number of customers.
* Grouping and filtering data using `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` clauses.
* SQL joins including `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, and `RIGHT JOIN`.
* Implementing queries related to customer orders, such as counting orders per salesperson, total sales, and customers by city.
